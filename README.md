## About

This repository contains the code for Team Tesseract's FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) robot controller. 
It's built using the Android Studio FTC SDK and is designed to control our robot during competitions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Android Studio installed with the FTC SDK.
*   An FTC-compatible robot and control hub.
*   A Driver Station phone or tablet.

### Building and Deploying

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  Connect your robot's control hub to your computer via USB.
4.  Build the project and deploy it to the control hub.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several packages:

*   `org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode`: This is the main package containing the OpModes (robot control programs).
*   `org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.subsystems`: This package contains classes representing the robot's subsystems (e.g., drive train, arm, intake).
*   `org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.util`: This package contains utility classes and functions used throughout the project.

## OpModes

The OpModes are located in the `org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode` package. They are named according to the following convention:

*   `TeleOp`: OpModes for teleoperated (driver-controlled) periods.
*   `Autonomous`: OpModes for autonomous (pre-programmed) periods.
